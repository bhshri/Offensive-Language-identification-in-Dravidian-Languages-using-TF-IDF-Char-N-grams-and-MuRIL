# Offensive-Language-identification-in-Dravidian-Languages-using-TF-IDF-Char-N-grams-and-MuRIL

This paper presents the participation of the IRNLPDAIICT team from Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing lab at DA-IICT, India in DravidianLangTech-EACL2021 Offensive Language identification in Dravidian Languages. The aim of this shared task is to identify Offensive Language from a code-mixed data-set of YouTube comments. The task is to classify comments into Not Offensive (NO), Offensive Untargetede(OU), Offensive Targeted Individual (OTI), Offensive Targeted Group (OTG), Offensive Targeted Others (OTO), Other Language (OL) for three Dravidian languages: Kannada, Malayalam and Tamil. We use TF-IDF character n-grams and pretrained MuRIL embeddings for text representation and Logistic Regression and Linear SVM for classification. Our best approach achieved Ninth, Third and Eighth with weighted F1 score of 0.64, 0.95 and 0.71in Kannada, Malayalam and Tamil on test dataset respectively.
